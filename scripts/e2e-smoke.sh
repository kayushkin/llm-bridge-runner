# Boot-and-answer smoke test for llm-bridge-runner.
#
# llm-bridge-runner is NOT a harness CLI. It has no -discover and no JSON-RPC
# loop; it registers a machine with an llm-bridge-server over an outbound
# WebSocket. So the harness-CLI smoke shape does not apply — its entrypoints are
# `enroll` (a one-time credential exchange that WRITES a durable token to disk)
# and `run` (the long-lived default).
#
# 🔴 ENROLMENT IS A STATE-CHANGING WRITE ON BOTH SIDES. It mints a durable
# per-machine token on the server and persists it locally. This smoke therefore
# NEVER touches the live llm-bridge-server: it stands up a stub server on a temp
# port that speaks just enough of POST /api/runner/enroll, and it redirects the
# config path into a sandbox. Pointing this at :8160 would enrol a phantom
# machine into the real fleet on every nightly run.
#
# What is asserted, and why each one can fail while `go build` is green:
#
#   1. -version / --help      the two zero-side-effect entrypoints answer.
#   2. `run` with NO config   must FAIL FAST AND LOUD (exit 1, message naming
#                             `enroll`) rather than hang or panic. This is the
#                             state a freshly-installed runner is in, and a hang
#                             here wedges the systemd unit silently.
#   3. `enroll` missing flags exits 2 without reaching the network.
#   4. `enroll` unreachable   errors cleanly AND WRITES NO CONFIG. A partially
#                             written config is worse than none: `run` would then
#                             dial forever with a token the server never issued.
#   5. `enroll` HTTP 500      surfaces the server's status, does not write config.
#   6. `enroll` happy path    against the stub: writes config.json at MODE 0600
#                             (it holds a bearer token — the mode is the contract),
#                             with the fields the server returned. This is the
#                             only assertion that exercises Enroll end-to-end:
#                             build request → POST → parse → SaveConfig.
#   7. `run` WITH a config    boots the production path, logs the dial, reports
#                             the disconnect against a closed port, and shuts
#                             down cleanly on SIGTERM. A runner that cannot be
#                             stopped is a runner that cannot be restarted.
#
# HERMETICITY IS AN ASSERTION HERE, NOT A PRECAUTION.
# PATH is curated to the system dirs because DetectHarnesses() (harness.go)
# exec.LookPath()s every harness wrapper on PATH and runs each with -version. A
# smoke whose enrol payload depends on which wrappers happen to be installed is
# not a guard, it is a coin flip — and several of those wrappers open live state
# databases when executed. The live config file is checksummed BEFORE the run and
# rechecked from the trap on EVERY exit path, including the failing ones: an
# assertion that only runs on success cannot tell you that the run which just
# failed also overwrote your real runner token on its way out.
#
# Exits 0 on success, non-zero on the first failing assertion.
#
# Tunables:
#   E2E_KEEP        — "1" leaves $TMP_DIR around after the run
#   E2E_STUB_PORT   — stub server listen port (default 19117)
